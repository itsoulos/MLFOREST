\begin_layout Abstract
Over the course of centuries,
 humanity has evolved,
 acquired knowledge,
 and developed an understanding of the geological phenomenon known as the earthquake.
 Earthquakes are not the result of the wrath of mythological beings,
 but rather of the dynamic processes occurring beneath the Earth’s crust specifically,
 the movement and interaction of tectonic / lithospheric plates.
 When one plate shifts relative to another,
 stress accumulates and is eventually released as seismic energy.
 This process is continuous and unstoppable.
 This phenomenon is well recognized in the Mediterranean region,
 where significant seismic activity arises from the northward convergence (4–10 mm per year) of the African plate relative to the Eurasian plate along a complex plate boundary.
 Consequently,
 our research will focus on the Mediterranean region,
 specifically examining seismic activity from 1990 - 2015 within the latitude range of 33–44° and longitude range of 17–44°.
 These geographical coordinates encompass 28 seismic zones,
 with the most active areas being Turkey and Greece.
 In this paper we achieved the construction of artificial features for the more effective discrimination of seismic events,
 utilizing the capabilities offered by Grammatical Evolution.
 Our results,
 as will be discussed in greater detail within the research,
 yield an average error of approximately 9%,
 corresponding to an overall accuracy of 91%.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
When entering the single keyword “earthquakes” into Google Scholar,
 more than 3,910,000 results are retrieved,
 demonstrating the intense interest that exists in the field of seismology.
 Thanks to these studies and investigations,
 which evolve from an initial idea or theory into practical applications,
 it can be stated with confidence that humanity is now capable of achieving timely early warning before seismic events occur.
 Consequently,
 the pursuit of sustainability strengthens our resilience against seismic phenomena.
 This has been achieved through the implementation of early warning systems established across the globe,
 particularly in technologically advanced countries that are also seismically vulnerable regions.
 For this purpose,
 the UN Disaster Risk Reduction was established,
 which is “aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk,
 all of which contribute to strengthening resilience and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development ”

 An early achievement of Disaster Risk Reduction took place in Japan in 1960,
 when seismic sensors were installed along the railway infrastructure to ensure the automatic immobilization of trains

 The primary function of Android applications is that,
 once an earthquake is detected,
 an alert is transmitted to all smartphones located within the affected area.
 Provided that the user is not in close proximity to the epicenter,
 the notification can be received in advance,
 allowing sufficient time to take protective action before the destructive seismic waves arrive

 By harnessing technology as an ally against natural disasters,
 humanity can move beyond the devastating consequences of major earthquakes,
 such as the 2004 Indian Ocean event with more than 220,000 fatalities,
 the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan with over 19,000 losses,
 and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake with more than 43,000 deaths.
 Accordingly,
 resilience and sustainability for populations affected by seismic events encompass both physical and social infrastructures capable of withstanding earthquakes,
 while simultaneously safeguarding long-term well-being through disaster risk reduction,
 community preparedness,
 and equitable recovery.

Subsequently,
 a preprocessing procedure was applied to the dataset.
 This included the identification of the lithospheric plate associated with each earthquake,
 to which a unique code was assigned.
 Furthermore,
 the months were categorized according to the four seasons,
 the days were grouped into ten-day intervals,
 and the time of occurrence was classified into four periods (morning,
 noon,
 afternoon,
 and night).
 The focal depth was divided into six categories.
 In addition,
 a new column was created to indicate,
 with a binary value (0 or 1),
 whether an earthquake had previously occurred in the same region during the same season.
 Finally,
 the dataset was merged with the Kp index,
 representing geomagnetic storm activity,
 which was further classified into six distinct categories.
 The final dataset was further processed,
 including the following:

At the following stage of data processing,
 we elected to focus on earthquakes with a magnitude code of 2 and above,
 since the inclusion of lower-magnitude events would bias the model toward predicting minor seismic occurrences.
 Specifically,
 the earthquakes were divided into two large classes to optimize performance:
 the first comprising magnitude codes 2 and 3,
 and the second encompassing events with magnitudes greater than 3.
 Following these steps,
 we proceeded with our experiments,
 utilizing approximately 10,000 seismic events in order to generate artificial features through Grammatical Evolution.
