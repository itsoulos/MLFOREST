\begin_layout Abstract
Over the course of centuries,
 humanity has evolved,
 acquired knowledge,
 and developed an understanding of the geological phenomenon known as the earthquake.
 Earthquakes are not the result of the wrath of mythological beings,
 but rather of the dynamic processes occurring beneath the Earth’s crust specifically,
 the movement and interaction of tectonic / lithospheric plates.
 When one plate shifts relative to another,
 stress accumulates and is eventually released as seismic energy.
 This process is continuous and unstoppable.
 This phenomenon is well recognized in the Mediterranean region,
 where significant seismic activity arises from the northward convergence (4–10 mm per year) of the African plate relative to the Eurasian plate along a complex plate boundary.
 Consequently,
 our research will focus on the Mediterranean region,
 specifically examining seismic activity from 1990 - 2015 within the latitude range of 33–44° and longitude range of 17–44°.
 These geographical coordinates encompass 28 seismic zones,
 with the most active areas being Turkey and Greece.
 In this paper we achieved the construction of artificial features for the more effective discrimination of seismic events,
 utilizing the capabilities offered by Grammatical Evolution.
 Our results,
 as will be discussed in greater detail within the research,
 yield an average error of approximately 9%,
 corresponding to an overall accuracy of 91%.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering the single keyword “earthquakes” into Google Scholar,
 more than 3,910,000 results are retrieved,
 demonstrating the intense interest that exists in the field of seismology.
 Thanks to these studies and investigations,
 which evolve from an initial idea or theory into practical applications,
 it can be stated with confidence that humanity is now capable of achieving timely early warning before seismic events occur.
 Consequently,
 the pursuit of sustainability strengthens our resilience against seismic phenomena.
 This has been achieved through the implementation of early warning systems established across the globe,
 particularly in technologically advanced countries that are also seismically vulnerable regions.
 For this purpose,
 the UN Disaster Risk Reduction was established,
 which is “aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk,
 all of which contribute to strengthening resilience and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development ”

 The primary function of Android applications is that,
 once an earthquake is detected,
 an alert is transmitted to all smartphones located within the affected area.
 Provided that the user is not in close proximity to the epicenter,
 the notification can be received in advance,
 allowing sufficient time to take protective action before the destructive seismic waves arrive

 By harnessing technology as an ally against natural disasters,
 humanity can move beyond the devastating consequences of major earthquakes,
 such as the 2004 Indian Ocean event with more than 220,000 fatalities,
 the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan with over 19,000 losses,
 and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake with more than 43,000 deaths.
 Accordingly,
 resilience and sustainability for populations affected by seismic events encompass both physical and social infrastructures capable of withstanding earthquakes,
 while simultaneously safeguarding long-term well-being through disaster risk reduction,
 community preparedness,
 and equitable recovery.

Subsequently,
 we will proceed with the presentation of related studies alongside our own,
 which progressively enhance both our sustainability and our capacity for prevention against seismic phenomena.
 Adeli,

 proposed a novel feature extraction technique,
 asserting that when combined with a selected Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN),
 it can yield reliable prediction outcomes for earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 4.5 to 6.0 on the Richter scale

 introduced a robust feature extraction approach,
 the Log-Sigmoid Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LSFCC),
 derived from the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC),
 for the classification of ground targets using geophones.
 Employing LSFCCs,
 the average classification accuracy for tracked and wheeled vehicles exceeds 89% across three distinct geographical settings,
 achieved with a single classifier trained in only one of these environments

 In contrast to the aforementioned studies,
 this paper introduces a novel approach Constructing artificial features with Grammatical Evolution for earthquake prediction.The grammatical evolution technique has been demonstrated in the following studies to yield more satisfactory results compared to other methods,
 as evidenced in the following research works:

This research work focuses on the creation of artificial features from existing ones,
 aiming at two goals:
 on the one hand,
 it seeks to reduce the required information required for the correct classification of seismic data and on the other hand,
 it seeks to highlight the hidden nonlinear correlations that may exist between the existing features of the objective problem.
 In this way,
 a significant improvement in the classification of seismic data will be achieved.

 given that it is certified by the CoreTrustSeal Standards and Certification Board.
 Furthermore,
 the selection of NSF data was driven by its advanced functionality and broad accessibility.
 Notably,
 it supports the download of up to 25,000 records per file,
 thereby streamlining the workflow and improving the efficiency of information retrieval.
 The region under investigation is presented in the subsequent table (2).

We employed coordinates spanning latitudes 33°–44° and longitudes 17°–44°,
 considered magnitude values from 1.0 to 10.0,
 and incorporated all available depths by default within the depth range.
 The raw dataset included the following variables:
 year,
 month,
 day,
 time,
 latitude (Lat),
 longitude (Lon),
 depth,
 magnitude,
 region,
 and timestamp.
 Accordingly,

Subsequently,
 a preprocessing procedure was applied to the dataset.
 This included the identification of the lithospheric plate associated with each earthquake,
 to which a unique code was assigned.
 Furthermore,
 the months were categorized according to the four seasons,
 the days were grouped into ten-day intervals,
 and the time of occurrence was classified into four periods (morning,
 noon,
 afternoon,
 and night).
 The focal depth was divided into six categories.
 In addition,
 a new column was created to indicate,
 with a binary value (0 or 1),
 whether an earthquake had previously occurred in the same region during the same season.
 Finally,
 the dataset was merged with the Kp index,
 representing geomagnetic storm activity,
 which was further classified into six distinct categories.
 The final dataset was further processed,
 including the following:
 Year,
 Epoch Code,
 Day Code,

At the following stage of data processing,
 we elected to focus on earthquakes with a magnitude code of 2 and above,
 since the inclusion of lower-magnitude events would bias the model toward predicting minor seismic occurrences.
 Specifically,
 the earthquakes were divided into two large classes to optimize performance:
 the first comprising magnitude codes 2 and 3,
 and the second encompassing events with magnitudes greater than 3.
 Following these steps,
 we proceeded with our experiments,
 utilizing approximately 10,000 seismic events in order to generate artificial features through Grammatical Evolution.

Global optimization methods for neural network training
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm is an evolutionary optimization method designed to minimize an objective function defined over a continuous search space.
 It operates on a population of candidate solutions,
 each represented as a vector of parameters.
 At the beginning of the process,
 an initial population is generated by sampling uniformly within the allowable bounds of the problem variables.
 Every candidate solution is then evaluated through the objective function,
 and the best individual is recorded.
 During each generation,
 the algorithm first evaluates all chromosomes in the population by computing their fitness values.
 The population is then sorted in ascending order of fitness,
 and a fixed proportion of the best-performing individuals is selected to act as parents for the next generation.
 The number of selected parents is determined by the selection rate,
 and only these top individuals participate in reproduction.
 Pairs of parents are chosen randomly from this elite subset,
 and new offspring are generated through a crossover procedure.
 For each selected pair,
 two offspring are produced by forming weighted combinations of the parents’ components,
 with the mixing weights drawn uniformly from an extended interval.
 This mechanism allows the offspring to inherit traits from both parents while also encouraging broader exploration of the search space.
 After crossover,
 a replacement step occurs,
 where the newly produced offspring fill the positions with the lower-ranking individuals in the population.
 Following replacement,
 the algorithm performs a mutation step on every chromosome:
 for each parameter,
 a random number is drawn,
 and if it does not exceed the mutation rate,
 that parameter is randomly altered.
 Mutation maintains diversity in the population and helps prevent premature convergence.
 Once all steps of the generation are completed,
 the generation counter is incremented,
 and the algorithm proceeds to the next iteration unless the maximum number of generations has been reached.
 When the evolutionary loop terminates,
 a final local search stage is applied exclusively to the best solution found during the entire evolutionary process.
 The purpose of this refinement step is to improve the quality of the best candidate by locally optimizing it using a dedicated local optimization method.
 The algorithm then returns this refined best solution along with its objective value.

\begin_layout Standard
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based search method inspired by how animals move and cooperate in groups like flocks of birds or schools of fish.
 The basic idea is that a group of “particles” explores the search space,
 each one representing a possible solution to the problem.
 Every particle has a position (the solution it currently represents) and a velocity (which determines how it will move in the next step).
 At the start of the algorithm,
 all particles are placed randomly within the allowed search boundaries,
 and they are given small random velocities so that their initial movements aren’t too aggressive.
 Each particle also keeps track of the best position it has discovered so far.
 At the same time,
 the swarm as a whole keeps track of the best position found by any particle,
 called the global best.
 During each iteration,
 every particle updates its velocity based on three things:
 its previous velocity,
 how strongly it is pulled toward its own personal best,
 and how strongly it is pulled toward the swarm’s global best.
 Two new random numbers are generated during this process,
 adding some randomness to help balance exploration and exploitation.
 Once the velocity has been updated,
 the particle moves to a new position,
 and that position is evaluated using the objective function.
 If this new position is better than the particle’s previous best,
 the best is updated.
 Similarly,
 if any particle finds a position that improves upon the current global best,
 the global best is updated as well.
 This way,
 information about promising areas of the search space spreads through the swarm over time.
 The algorithm repeats these steps updating velocities,
 moving particles,
 evaluating them,
 and updating the global best until a stopping condition is reached.
 This could be a maximum number of iterations.
 When the algorithm finishes,
 it returns the best solution found by the swarm and the corresponding objective value.
