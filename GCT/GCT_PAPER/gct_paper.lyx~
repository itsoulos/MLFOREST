\begin_layout Abstract
Over the course of centuries,
 humanity has evolved,
 acquired knowledge,
 and developed an understanding of the geological phenomenon known as the earthquake.
 Earthquakes are not the result of the wrath of mythological beings,
 but rather of the dynamic processes occurring beneath the Earth’s crust specifically,
 the movement and interaction of tectonic / lithospheric plates.
 When one plate shifts relative to another,
 stress accumulates and is eventually released as seismic energy.
 This process is continuous and unstoppable.
 This phenomenon is well recognized in the Mediterranean region,
 where significant seismic activity arises from the northward convergence (4–10 mm per year) of the African plate relative to the Eurasian plate along a complex plate boundary.
 Consequently,
 our research will focus on the Mediterranean region,
 specifically examining seismic activity from 1990 - 2015 within the latitude range of 33–44° and longitude range of 17–44°.
 These geographical coordinates encompass 28 seismic zones,
 with the most active areas being Turkey and Greece.
 In this paper we applied Grammatical Evolution for artificial feature construction in earthquake prediction,
 evaluated against machine learning approaches including MLP(GEN),
 MLP(PSO),
 SVM,
 and NNC.
 Experiments showed that Feature Construction (FC) achieved the best performance,
 with a mean error of 9.05% and overall accuracy of 91%,
 outperforming SVM.
 Further analysis revealed that a single constructed feature (Nf = 1) yielded the lowest average error (8.21%),
 while varying the number of generations indicated that Ng = 200 provided an effective balance between computational cost and predictive accuracy.
 These findings confirm the efficiency of FC in enhancing earthquake prediction models through artificial feature construction.
 Our results,
 as will be discussed in greater detail within the research,
 yield an average error of approximately 9%,
 corresponding to an overall accuracy of 91%.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering the single keyword “earthquakes” into Google Scholar,
 more than 3,910,000 results are retrieved,
 demonstrating the intense interest that exists in the field of seismology.
 Thanks to these studies and investigations,
 which evolve from an initial idea or theory into practical applications,
 it can be stated with confidence that humanity is now capable of achieving timely early warning before seismic events occur.
 Consequently,
 the pursuit of sustainability strengthens our resilience against seismic phenomena.
 This has been achieved through the implementation of early warning systems established across the globe,
 particularly in technologically advanced countries that are also seismically vulnerable regions.
 For this purpose,
 the UN Disaster Risk Reduction was established,
 which is “aimed at preventing new and reducing existing disaster risk and managing residual risk,
 all of which contribute to strengthening resilience and therefore to the achievement of sustainable development ”

 The primary function of Android applications is that,
 once an earthquake is detected,
 an alert is transmitted to all smartphones located within the affected area.
 Provided that the user is not in close proximity to the epicenter,
 the notification can be received in advance,
 allowing sufficient time to take protective action before the destructive seismic waves arrive

 By harnessing technology as an ally against natural disasters,
 humanity can move beyond the devastating consequences of major earthquakes,
 such as the 2004 Indian Ocean event with more than 220,000 fatalities,
 the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan with over 19,000 losses,
 and the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake with more than 43,000 deaths.
 Accordingly,
 resilience and sustainability for populations affected by seismic events encompass both physical and social infrastructures capable of withstanding earthquakes,
 while simultaneously safeguarding long-term well-being through disaster risk reduction,
 community preparedness,
 and equitable recovery.

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequently,
 we will proceed with the presentation of related studies alongside our own,
 which progressively enhance both our sustainability and our capacity for prevention against seismic phenomena.

 comprising events with a Richter magnitude (ML) of 5 and a depth of 300 km within the study area (21°–26° N,
 119°–123° E).
 This dataset was utilized as training input to develop the initial earthquake magnitude prediction backpropagation neural network (IEMPBPNN) model,
 which was designed with two hidden layers

 Zhang,
 in 2019,
 proposed a precursory pattern-based feature extraction approach aimed at improving earthquake prediction performance.
 In this method,
 raw seismic data are initially segmented into fixed daily time intervals,
 with the magnitude of the largest earthquake within each interval designated as the main shock

 for earthquake prediction,
 marking the first application of this evolutionary technique in the field of seismology.
 While the method does not directly address a specific gap in the literature,
 the experiments demonstrated that feature construction achieved an overall accuracy of 91%,
 thereby contributing to the advancement of earthquake prediction research.
 We consider this contribution significant in enhancing the understanding of seismic phenomena and in highlighting the potential of Grammatical Evolution as a promising tool for feature engineering in geophysical datasets.
 In particular,
 the method of Grammatical Evolution can be considered as a genetic algorithm

 This research work focuses on the creation of artificial features from existing ones,
 aiming at two goals:
 on the one hand,
 it seeks to reduce the required information required for the correct classification of seismic data and on the other hand,
 it seeks to highlight the hidden nonlinear correlations that may exist between the existing features of the objective problem.
 In this way,
 a significant improvement in the classification of seismic data will be achieved.

Dataset Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We obtained and systematically analyzed 511,064 earthquake events from 1990 to 2015,
 as this time period is of particular scientific interest due to the surge in seismic activity,
 as also illustrated in the graph of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Specifically,
 we selected this time period because it encompasses a wide range of earthquake magnitudes,
 which provides a diverse dataset conducive to algorithm training and supports the construction of artificial features via Grammatical Evolution.
 Moreover,
 our analysis led us to the conclusion that the datasets from 1970–1989 and 2016–2025 lack the diversity observed in the dataset we selected.
 Specifically,
 classes 6 and 7 are entirely absent from the 1970–1989 records,
 while in the post-2016 data class 7 is missing and class 1 contains only a limited number of instances,
 namely 25.

On the platform that provides us with the Interactive Earthquake Browser we employed coordinates spanning latitudes 33°–44° and longitudes 17°–44°,
 considered magnitude values from 1.0 to 10.0,
 and incorporated all available depths by default within the depth range.
 The raw dataset included the following variables:
 year,
 month,
 day,
 time,
 latitude (Lat),
 longitude (Lon),
 depth,
 magnitude,

Subsequently,
 a preprocessing procedure was applied to the dataset.
 This included the identification of the lithospheric plate associated with each earthquake,
 to which a unique code was assigned.
 Furthermore,
 the months were categorized according to the four seasons,
 the days were grouped into ten-day intervals,
 and the time of occurrence was classified into four periods (morning,
 noon,
 afternoon,
 and night).
 The focal depth was divided into six categories.
 In addition,
 a new column was created to indicate,
 with a binary value (0 or 1),
 whether an earthquake had previously occurred in the same region during the same season.
 Finally,
 the dataset was merged with the Kp index,
 representing geomagnetic storm activity,
 which was further classified into six distinct categories.
 The final dataset was further processed,
 including the following:
 Year,
 Epoch Code,
 Day Code,
 Time Code,
 Latitude,
 Longitude,
 Depth Code,
 Previous Magnitude Code,
 Same Region Code,
 Lithospheric/Tectonic Plate,
 Kp Code.

In the processed dataset,
 categorical classes were introduced to facilitate the analysis.
 Specifically,
 the months were initially ordered numerically and subsequently grouped according to the corresponding season.
 Thus,
 class 0 represents the winter months,
 class 1 corresponds to the spring months,
 class 2 to the summer months,
 and class 3 to the autumn months.
 The days comprising each month were divided into three ten-day intervals,
 with the first interval assigned to class 0,
 the second interval to class 1,
 and the final interval to class 2.
 Accordingly,
 the hours of the 24 hour day were divided into distinct periods,
 with the morning zone assigned to class 0,
 midday to class 1,
 afternoon to class 2,
 and night to class 3.
 For the depth code,
 earthquakes occurring near the surface (0–32.9 km) were assigned to class 0,
 those recorded at depths between 33–69.9 km to class 1,
 events within 70–149.9 km to class 2,
 those between 150–299.9 km to class 3,
 earthquakes at depths of 300–499.9 km to class 4,
 those between 500–799.9 km to class 5,
 and finally,
 events occurring at depths greater than 800 km were assigned to class 6.
 Continuing,
 earthquakes with magnitudes below 2.9 were assigned to class 1,
 those with magnitudes between 3.0–3.9 to class 2,
 magnitudes between 4.0–4.9 to class 3,
 magnitudes between 5.0–5.9 to class 4,
 magnitudes between 6.0–6.9 to class 5,
 magnitudes between 7.0–7.9 to class 6,
 while events with magnitudes of 8.0 and above were assigned to class 7.
 With regard to the categorization of the geographical region and the lithospheric plate,
 each region was assigned a code ranging from 1 to 28.
 Similarly,
 a code from 1 to 7 was allocated to the lithospheric plates corresponding to each seismic event.
 Finally,
 the Kp code was classified as follows:
 values ranging from 0.000–4.000 were assigned to class 0,
 those from 4.100–5.000 to class 1,
 values between 5.100–6.000 to class 2,
 those from 6.100–7.000 to class 3,
 values between 7.100–8.000 to class 4,
 and finally,
 values from 8.100–9.000 were assigned to class 5.

\begin_layout Standard
At the following stage of data processing,
 we elected to focus on earthquakes with a magnitude code of 2 and above,
 since the inclusion of lower-magnitude events would bias the model toward predicting minor seismic occurrences.
 Notably,
 the small-magnitude category (1–2.9 mag) prevailed as the majority class with 407,144 records,
 creating a significant imbalance in the dataset.
 By excluding this dominant class,
 we aimed to achieve a more balanced distribution across magnitudes and to enhance the representational capacity of the model.
 This approach is consistent with previous studies that have similarly excluded small earthquakes to mitigate bias and improve predictive performance.

In summary,
 the seismic data employed in this study were recorded on the magnitude scale,
 covering events from 1 to 10.
 Initially,
 we excluded small earthquakes,
 which predominated in number and affected the balance of the dataset.
 The data source was the EarthScope Consortium,
 which operates the NSF Geodetic Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience (GAGE) and the NSF Seismological Facility for the Advancement of Geoscience (SAGE).
 These records were obtained from thousands of stations worldwide,

 the SVM algorithm has been employed both in studies on earthquake prediction and in research on the early detection of seismic phenomena,
 as demonstrated in the following works:

 As with other comparative analyses of models,
 SVMs require greater computational resources during training and exhibit reduced susceptibility to overfitting,
 whereas neural networks are generally regarded as more adaptable and capable of scaling effectively.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation the value 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 represents the number of used computation units (weights) for the neural network.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 denotes the vector containing the parameters of the neural network and vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 represents the input vector (pattern).
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$

 stands for the sigmoid function,
 which is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}

 The values are expressed as percentage classification error,
 that is,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The row AVERAGE denotes the average classification error for all datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most striking observation is that FC achieves the lowest error for all five datasets,
 with no exceptions.
 For every GCT year,
 the FC column attains the minimum error among all models,
 demonstrating a consistent and temporally robust superiority.
 This pattern is clearly reflected in the AVERAGE row:
 the mean classification error of FC is 9.05%,
 whereas the corresponding mean error of the best conventional baseline,
 the SVM,
 is 11.86%.
 Moving from 11.86% to 9.05% corresponds to an error reduction of approximately 24-25%,
 meaning that roughly one quarter of the misclassifications made by the SVM are eliminated when using FC.
 Compared with the neural approaches,
 the gain is even more pronounced:
 FC reduces the mean error from 39.22% to 9.05% for MLP(GEN),
 from 35.37% to 9.05% for MLP(PSO),
 and from 25.29% to 9.05% for NNC,
 effectively absorbing about 64-77% of their errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining the behaviour per year reveals how the proposed model interacts with the specific characteristics of each temporal subset.
 Dataset GCT2005 appears to be the “easiest” case for all models,
 with the SVM dropping to 6.85% error and FC reaching 4.45%,
 which corresponds to an accuracy of about 95.5%.
 At the opposite end of the spectrum,
 GCT2010 is clearly the most challenging dataset,
 as indicated by substantially increased errors for the conventional models (MLP(GEN) 52.89%,
 MLP(PSO) 44.77%,
 NNC 29.81%) and by a higher error for the SVM (14.46%).
 Even in this difficult scenario,
 FC keeps the error below 10% (9.97%),
 preserving a clear qualitative advantage in the most demanding temporal setting.
 A similar pattern emerges for the intermediate years 1995 and 2000,
 where FC-SVM absolute differences are in the range of 2-4 percentage points,
 corresponding to roughly 20-35% relative error reduction.
 This suggests that as the data become more complex,
 the benefit of the automatically constructed features generated by Grammatical Evolution becomes increasingly pronounced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second important finding is that the ranking of the conventional models remains stable across all years.
 The SVM is consistently the best among the standard baselines,
 followed by NNC and the two MLP variants,
 with MLP(PSO) systematically outperforming MLP(GEN).
 This stability reinforces the credibility of the table as a benchmark,
 indicating that the results are not driven by noise or random fluctuations but instead reflect a coherent hierarchy of model performance.
 On top of this stable baseline,
 FC does not merely swap the winner for a single dataset,
 it establishes a new performance level by consistently pushing the error rates to substantially lower values in every year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a practical standpoint,
 given that the final processed dataset contains on the order of 10,000 seismic events,
 an average error of 11.86% compared with 9.05% implies hundreds fewer misclassified instances when FC is used instead of a plain SVM trained on the original features.
 This has direct implications for early warning and risk assessment applications,
 where each reduction in misclassification translates into more reliable decision-making.
 The evidence from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 combined with the methodological description,
 strongly supports the view that the feature construction phase based on Grammatical Evolution is not a minor refinement over existing classifiers,
 but rather a key component that reshapes the feature space so that the seismic classes become much more separable.
 This explains why the proposed FC model achieves an average error of approximately 9%,
 in full agreement with the reported overall accuracy of 91% in the abstract.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 Table 6 shows that FC is not only the best-performing model in each individual year but also the most stable across different temporal subsets,
 confirming that the future-construction approach with Grammatical Evolution yields a substantial and consistent improvement over standard machine learning models for the discrimination of seismic events.

\begin_layout Standard
The repeated-measures ANOVA with Method as the within-subject factor and DATASET (year) as the blocking factor confirms that the choice of classifier has a statistically significant effect on the classification error,
 indicating that the models are not equivalent in terms of predictive performance.
 Building on this global result,
 we conducted pairwise paired t-tests between the proposed FC model and each baseline,
 using one-sided alternatives that explicitly test the hypothesis that FC achieves lower mean error than its competitors.
 The resulting p-values,
 visualised as significance stars on the boxplot,
 show that the superiority of FC is statistically supported across all comparisons (Figure

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular,
 the comparisons FC vs MLP(GEN) and FC vs NNC yield ** (p < 0.01),
 indicating that the probability of observing differences of this magnitude in favour of FC purely by chance is below 1%.
 An even stronger effect emerges for FC vs MLP(PSO),
 which is marked with *** (p < 0.001),
 reflecting the very large performance gap between FC and the PSO-trained MLP.
 Finally,
 the comparison FC vs SVM is annotated with * (p < 0.05),
 showing that,
 although the numerical difference in error is smaller than in the neural baselines,
 it remains statistically significant in favour of FC.
 Overall,
 the pattern of significance codes (*,
 **,
 ***) corroborates the message of Table 6:
 FC is not only the best-performing model in terms of average classification error,
 but its advantage over all other methods is statistically significant,
 with particularly strong evidence against the MLP-based models and clear,
 though more moderate,
 evidence against the already very competitive SVM baseline.

 investigates the behavior of the proposed FC model as the number of constructed features N_f varies from 1 to 4.
 The results show that performance is generally very stable,
 with the mean classification error ranging within a narrow band between 8.21% (for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 = 1) and 9.34% (for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 = 4).
 The lowest average error is obtained with a single constructed feature (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 =1),
 whereas the configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 =2,
 which is adopted as the default setting in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 yields a mean error of 9.05%,
 very close to the optimum and with highly consistent behaviour across all years.
 In some datasets,
 such as GCT2005,
 slightly better values appear for larger 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 (e.g.,
 4.38% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 = 4 versus 4.40% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 = 1),
 but these gains are marginal and do not change the overall picture.
 Taken together,
 the results indicate that FC does not require a large number of future constructions to perform well:
 one or two constructed features are sufficient to achieve very low error rates,
 while further increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 does not lead to systematic improvements and likely introduces redundant information that does not translate into better generalization.
 This supports the view that the quality of the features generated by Grammatical Evolution is more important than their quantity,
 and that the proposed choice 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 = 2 offers a well-balanced compromise between performance and model simplicity.

 focuses on the number of generations 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 of the evolutionary algorithm during feature construction and evaluates four values (50,
 100,
 200,
 400).
 The results demonstrate that FC is remarkably robust with respect to this hyperparameter:
 the mean classification error remains very close across settings,
 ranging from 9.18% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 100 down to 8.78% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 400.
 The configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 200,
 which is used as the default in the previous analysis,
 attains an average error of 9.05%,
 essentially indistinguishable from the more expensive setting 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 400,
 which improves the mean error only by about a quarter of a percentage point.
 At the level of individual datasets there are cases where a larger number of generations yields more noticeable gains (for instance,
 GCT1990 improves to 12.30% at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 400),
 but the overall pattern is that most of the benefit is already captured within 100-200 generations,
 with further iterations providing diminishing returns.
 Thus,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:resultsNG"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 suggests that the Grammatical Evolution process converges to useful future constructions relatively quickly,
 and that the choice 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 = 200 offers a very good trade-off between computational cost and predictive performance,
 avoiding unnecessary increases in training time without delivering substantial accuracy gains.

\begin_layout Standard
This study investigates the use of Grammatical Evolution for constructing artificial features in earthquake prediction,
 applying several machine learning approaches,
 including MLP(GEN),
 MLP(PSO),
 SVM,
 and NNC,
 alongside Feature Construction (FC).
 The analysis is based on seismic data recorded between 1990 and 2015 within the geographical area defined by latitudes 33°–44° and longitudes 17°–44°.
 While all the aforementioned methods belong to the domain of machine learning,
 FC is distinguished as a feature engineering technique.
 Specifically,
 Feature Construction (FC) refers to the process of generating new,
 informative attributes from the existing dataset,
 thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the data and improving the performance of machine learning models.
 Following these steps,
 our experiments demonstrated that the FC technique yielded the best results,
 achieving the lowest mean error 9.05% corresponding to an overall accuracy of 91%.
 The SVM method achieved the second-best performance,
 with an average error of 11.86%.
 Consequently,
 we proceeded with the FC technique,
 which yielded the best results,
 and implemented artificially constructed features 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 with ranging from 1 to 4.
 Furthermore,
 to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method,
 an additional experiment was conducted in which the number of generations 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 was varied from 50 to 400.
 Consequently,
 we applied 1,
 2,
 3,
 and 4 constructed features within this technique,
 with the single constructed feature
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}$
\end_inset

 =1 exhibiting superior performance compared to the others producing the minimal average error 8.21%.
 Our experiment was further extended by incorporating a series of values for the number of generations
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 (50,
 100,
 200,
 and 400),
 and the results indicated that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 400 generations yielded the best performance 8.78%.
 In contrast,
 selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 200 provides also an effective balance between computational cost and predictive performance.
 This study was conducted as a direct response to the challenge identified in our previous research,
 thereby extending and refining the scope of the earlier findings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifically,
 the study demonstrates the potential of Grammatical Evolution as a novel feature engineering tool in seismology,
 offering a new perspective on how artificial features can enhance earthquake prediction models.
 At the same time,
 certain limitations must be acknowledged,
 such as the imbalance in the dataset and the restriction to a specific geographical region,
 which may affect generalizability.
 Future research should therefore explore the application of this approach to diverse seismic catalogs,
 investigate its integration with machines learning architectures.
 By articulating these implications,
 limitations,
 and directions,
 the contribution of the study becomes clearer and more impactful.
