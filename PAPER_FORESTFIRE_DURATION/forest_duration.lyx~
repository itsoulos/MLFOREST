% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
Forest and urban fires are a major problem in the modern era that tests
 the endurance of governments to extinguish them.
 Fires can cause economic and ecological problems especially in the summer
 months.
 In modern times, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence can be
 a weapon for predicting the evolution of fires or even for their prevention.
 Specifically, through Machine Learning, which is one part of Artificial
 Intelligence several methods have been incorporated to detect the duration
 of fires using data which are freely available from the Fire Service of
 Greece for a period of 10 years.

\series bold
 
\series default
For this purpose, a wide range of machine learning techniques were used
 on this data and the experimental results were more than encouraging.
