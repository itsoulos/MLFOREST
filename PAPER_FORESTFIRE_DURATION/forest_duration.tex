\abstract{Forest and urban fires are a major problem in the modern era that
tests the endurance of governments to extinguish them. Fires can cause
economic and ecological problems especially in the summer months.
In modern times, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence
can be a weapon for predicting the evolution of fires or even for
their prevention. Specifically, through Machine Learning, which is
one part of Artificial Intelligence several methods have been incorporated
to detect the duration of fires using data which are freely available
from the Fire Service of Greece for a period of 10 years.\textbf{
}For this purpose, a wide range of machine learning techniques were
used on this data and the experimental results were more than encouraging.}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data pre - processing }

\subsection{The proposed algorithms}

\subsubsection{Bayes Net }

The Bayesian Networks, are Probabilistic Graphical Models, they can
create: diagnostic models, causal models, decision making, prediction,
e.t.c. \citep{bayes_net1}. Therefore, the Bayes Net, is considered
as a useful tool, in prediction and detection area, of forest/ wildfires
fires. Consequently, it follows a brief reference, of two papers. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The specific algorithms, was used, in study: A Bayesian network model
for prediction and analysis of possible forest fires causes, in 2020.
The study was conducted in Mugla, of Turkey. The model showed, that
the most effective factors, on forest fires ignition, were: the month,
and the temperature \citep{bayes_net2}. 
\item In 2021, it was published, on MDPI, the survey: A Bayesian Network
-- Based Information Fusion Combined with DNNS for Robust Video Fire
Detection. The combination, Regional -- Convolutional Neural Network
(R -- CNN), Long -- Short term memory (LSTM), and Bayesian Net,
proved that the last one, not only improves the detection accuracy,
of forest / wildfires\ensuremath{\centerdot} but also reduces the
decision making \citep{bayes_net3}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Naive Bayes }

The Naïve Bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm, used for
classification tasks. This classifier, use principles of probability
in order to perform classification tasks \citep{naive_bayes1}. One
of the strong points, of the algorithm, is the amenable improvements,
and modifications, as to achieve better results in research, such
as the forest wildfires prediction. 
\begin{itemize}
\item A proportional modification was found in the following research, which
was published on MDPI: Towards Fire prediction Accuracy Enhancements
by Leveraging an Improved Naïve Bayes Algorithm. In the aforementioned
paper, there was an evolutionary algorithm, the Double Weighted Naïve
Bayes with Compensation Coefficient (DWCNB)\ensuremath{\centerdot}
which compared with Naïve Bayes, and Double Weighted Naïve Bayes.
The results showed a prediction accuracy of 98.13\%, higher than Naïve
Bayes for 5.08\%, and respectively 2.52\% than Double weighted Naïve
Bayes \citep{naive_bayes2}. 
\item In a recent research, 2024, in Turkey, it was used different algorithms
so as to extract the highest accuracy, for forest / wildfires. The
paper, was: Predicting forest fire vulnerability using machine learning
approaches in the Mediterranean region: a case study in Turkiye. The
study compared: Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural
Networks, and Support Vector machines. The Random Forest algorithm,
yielded the highest accuracy, while Naïve Bayes performed consistently,
albeit lower than Random Forest, and Decision Tree \citep{naive_bayes3}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}

Like the previous algorithm, Logistic Regression, works also with
machine learning classification, and used to predict probabilities.
This (ML) technique used in data sets with many features \citep{logistic1}.
The Logistic Regression, is widely used in natural hazards, such as
fire modeling by estimating, the probability of occurrences, according
the following survey: A Survey of Machine Learning Algorithms based
Forest Fires Prediction and Detection \citep{logistic2} 

\subsubsection{Mlp Network }

The Multilayer Perceptron is a commonly used Neural Network. It composed
of multiple layers, and contains a set of perception elements known
as neurons. It is used in forecasting models, and image pattern recognition
\citep{nn1,nn2}. In a Chinese province, in 2022, was conducted the
research: Using Multilayer Perceptron to Predict Forest Fires in Jiangxi
Province, Southeast China. In this paper, several models were studied
for the occurrence of forest fires. ROC plots were used to compare
results from: (MLP), Logistic, and SVM. The (MLP) model scored the
highest percentage, compared to the rest. Precisely, (MLP) scored
0.984, Logistic 0.933, and SVM 0.974 \citep{nn_forest}. 

\subsubsection{The J48 algorithm }

J48, belong to the of Decision Tree algorithm, in supervised learning.
Creates a decision tree, which breaks into subsets. It used in risk
analysis, pattern recognition and makes predictions \citep{j48_1}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item J48, was selected among with Random Forest (RF), adaboostM1, and Bagging,
in Algeria, 2020, for the project: Predicting Forest Fires in Algeria
using Data Mining Techniques: Case study of the Decision Tree Algorithm.
Although, the results showed best performance, with adaBoostM1 (84.21\%),
the researchers do not recommend it due it needs significant resources
and effort to be translated to hardware implementation. Therefore,
they recommend J48 with accuracy (82,89\%). The (RF) came up to (72,36\%),
and Bagging to (78,94\%) {[}12{]}.
\item In a study, to Slovenia, 2005, the J48, had the lowest result. Specifically,
on the paper: Learning to Predict Forest Fires with Different data
Mining Techniques, highlighted the Bagging, as the most efficient
in relation to: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, J48, και Boosting
{[}13{]}. 
\end{itemize}
