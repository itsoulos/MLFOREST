\begin_layout Abstract
From early times, humanity has expressed a profound need to predict the
 future.
 In ancient Greece, oracles held a place of high respect, and influence.
 In modern times, the quest for accurate forecasting, has shifted to the
 realms, of research and science∙ empowered by advanced computational tools,
 provided by Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning.
 One of the fields, where Machine Learning, has established a fertile ground
 is in the domain, of forest fire management.
 Forest fires, pose a major threat to both human, and animal life, with
 significant economic and social impacts.
 A reliable prediction system is crucial for mitigating these effects, especiall
y during summer months, dry seasons, and in high-risk areas, such as the
 Mediterranean.
 This study, explores feature construction, and selection methods, applied
 to forest fire data, collected over 10 years in Greece, incorporating prevailin
g weather conditions at ignition, and during suppression.
 By applying techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum
 Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) feature selection, and Grammatical
 Evolution for feature construction, this research aims to identify key
 factors influencing fire duration.
 These techniques, have become invaluable allies, in addressing complex
 predictive challenges, and advancing, our understanding of future events.
 Our approach, leverages advanced computational methods, to analyze complex
 datasets, providing a deeper understanding of the primary drivers, of wildfire
 behavior, and enabling more effective mitigation strategies.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fire, has always had a dual nature, in human history.
 On one hand, it has had the power to destroy civilizations, while on the
 other, it has significantly contributed to the evolution, of human society.
 From its destructive potential in warfare, and natural disasters, to its
 transformative role in technological, and cultural advancement, fire has
 shaped both, the rise, and fall of human civilizations.
 The ability to harness fire for cooking, metallurgy, and warmth played
 a crucial role in the development, of early human societies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, while its unchecked force, has also led to widespread devastation.
 This duality, underscores fire’s paradoxical role, in human progress: a
 force capable of both creation and destruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This notion, is also evident in ancient Greek mythology, particularly in
 the tale of Prometheus, who defied the gods by stealing fire, and gifting
 it to humanity.
 This act symbolizes the transfer of divine knowledge and power to humans,
 enabling progress and civilization.
 The myth, underscores fire's dual role, as a tool for human advancement,
 and as a source of conflict, illustrating the tension between progress
 and its ethical implications, as well as the costs of rebellion and innovation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 On this matter, fire, has played a multifaceted role in human history,
 both through myths and through its tangible impacts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, in the modern era, wildfires are ranked among the most significant
 natural hazards

, with immense effects on Earth's ecosystems, and human societies.
 Beyond that, according, the Chair, of ISO/TC 92, fire safety, Mr.

In other words, wildfires and climate change, intensify each other.
 Climate change, exacerbates wildfires by increasing drought, high temperatures,
 low humidity, lightning, and strong winds, leading to more severe, and
 prolonged fire seasons.
 Conversely, wildfires contribute to worsening climate change 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fire5"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, wildfires (along with the extraction and burning of fossil fuels,
 and volcanic eruptions) exacerbate Climate Change, by further releasing
 carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere

 Therefore, despite the challenging circumstances posed by Climate Change,
 driven by continuous human expansion, and technological progress, we aim

 on advancing technology itself.
 On this, Artificial intelligence, particularly Machine learning, emerges
 as a valuable ally in addressing this global issue, offering innovative

 improving their performance over time, without explicitly being programmed
 for specific tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Namely, Machine learning, is a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence,
 presents endless opportunities for businesses, and society alike.
 Beyond its numerous advantages, it plays a critical role in driving groundbreak
ing advancements, in Climate Change adaptation, and mitigation.
 By accelerating, the development of solutions, to some of the most pressing
 challenges facing the planet, machine learning, is reshaping the way we
 address global environmental issues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Although, modeling complex environmental variables, often presents challenges,
 due to the significant computational resources required, and the diversity
 or complexity of data formats 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ml_review"

\end_inset

.
 Machine learning algorithms, however, can bypass these challenges, by deriving
 mappings, and relationships directly from the data, eliminating the need
 for predefined expert rules.
 This capability, is particularly beneficial when dealing with scenarios,
 involving a large number of parameters, with intricate physical properties,
 such as in forest fires.
 Consequently, adopting a machine learning approach to fire management,
 can help overcome many of the limitations, associated with traditional
 physics-based simulation models.
\end_layout

Regarding this, in the recent literature, significant interest has been
 developed, in the role of machine learning, in the field of fire management

 Forest fires, however, have not been extensively studied, as research on
 forest fires constitutes only 2.9% of the global literature, according to
 a study conducted between 2017 and 2021 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 More specifically, floods have received the most attention in research
 (20.3%), followed by earthquakes and hurricanes, each accounting for 18.8%.
 Studies on general disaster types make up 15.9%, while landslides account
 for 10.1%.
 Notably, depending on the area of focus, researchers employ corresponding
 algorithms, to address specific challenges.

 management, as obtained from the relevant literature.
 A number of recent publications have appeared in recent years, which utilize
 machine learning techniques for forest fire management.
 For example, Bayesian networks have been widely utilized in the context
 of forest fires, particularly for predicting, and analyzing, potential
 causes of fires 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

The PCA method

\begin_layout Standard
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, introduced by mathematician
 Karl Pearson in 1901 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and developed by Harold Hotelling (1933).
 This technique, operates on the principle when data from a higher-dimensional
 space is transformed into a lower-dimensional space, the resulting lower-dimens
ional representation should retain the maximum variance, of the original
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably, it is worth mentioning that the use of PCA, on larger datasets,
 became practical only after the advent of electronic computers, which made
 it computationally feasible, to handle datasets, beyond trivial sizes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Continuing, with the applications of PCA, it is a widely utilized technique
 in exploratory data analysis, and machine learning, particularly, in building
 predictive models.
 It is an unsupervised learning method, designed to analyze, the relationships
 among a set of variables.
 Often referred to as a form of general factor analysis, it involves regression
 to determine a line of best fit.
 The primary objective, of PCA, is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset,
 while retaining the most significant patterns, and relationships, among
 the variables, all without requiring prior knowledge, of the target variables

Next, we will briefly reference studies, that have utilized PCA, covering
 different areas, such as: statistical physics, genetic improvement, face
 recognition, economic & environmental sciences, medical prediction, e.t.c.
 Explicitly, the research conducted, by Park 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pca_park"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, highlights the reasons behind the success of the PCA technique, for lattice
 systems.
 The study's primary limitation lies in the dependency of the proposed formula's
 accuracy on the dataset size.
 Specifically, the results achieve full precision, only under the condition
 of an infinite dataset.
 This constraint restricts the practical applicability, of the method, when
 working with finite or limited data, a common scenario, in real-world analyses.

Additionally, the work of Sarma et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 utilizes PCA, in order to evaluate, morphometric traits, under a multivariate
 approach.
 The findings suggest, that PCA could significantly enhance the genetic
 improvement.
 Noteworthy, is the fact, that the 64.29%, of the total variance explained,
 can be considered relatively low.
 This suggests, that a significant amount of unexplained information remains,
 which is not captured, by the four principal components.
 Moreover, Gambardella et al.
 used the PCA technique for monitoring the cultivation, of cannabis, in
 Albania.
 Specifically, with PCA they remove redundant spectral information from
 multiband datasets

, the results of the Wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons of the classificatio
n models are presented, providing valuable insights into the statistical
 significance of their performance differences.
 Below is a more in-depth analysis, focusing on the interpretation of results
 and a deeper understanding of the relationships between the models.
 The overall result of the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.5) confirms that statistically
 significant differences exist among the models' performances.
 This indicates that the models are not equivalent in terms of their accuracy,
 with some clearly outperforming others.
 The comparison between FC and NNC (p = 0.039) reveals a statistically significan
t difference, though the p-value is relatively close to the significance
 threshold (commonly p < 0.05).
 This suggests that while FC outperforms NNC, the difference is not exceedingly
 pronounced.
 This outcome might be influenced by specific data characteristics or variations
 in the models' stability.
 The comparison between FC and PCA (p = 0.016) shows a clearer statistically
 significant difference.
 FC's performance is evidently superior to PCA’s, which may be attributed
 to the fundamental differences in their methodologies.
 PCA, as a dimensionality reduction technique, might lose critical information
 in the data, leading to lower accuracy in certain scenarios.
 For the comparison between FC and MRMR (p = 0.039), a statistically significant
 difference is observed once again.
 Similar to the FC-NNC comparison, this difference exists but is not highly
 pronounced.
 MRMR, which selects features based on mutual information, might not perform
 as consistently across all datasets, giving FC an edge.
 The comparison between FC and BFGS (p = 0.016) indicates an even more distinct
 difference.
 BFGS, as an optimization method, may lack the flexibility or precision
 required for classification tasks, allowing FC to demonstrate more stable
 and superior performance in this case.
 The difference between FC and ADAM (p = 0.023) is also statistically significant.
 While ADAM is generally considered an effective algorithm in many contexts,
 FC appears to outperform it in this analysis, possibly due to better adaptabili
ty to the specific characteristics of the dataset.
 The most striking difference is seen in the comparison between FC and BAYES
 (p = 0.0078).
 The very low p-value strongly confirms a statistically significant difference,
 highlighting FC’s clear superiority over BAYES.
 Notably, BAYES has exhibited high variability in its performance, especially
 in 2017, when it recorded a very high error rate.
 This variability likely reduces its overall reliability, which is reflected
 in this comparison.
 In summary, FC consistently outperforms all other models in this analysis,
 with statistically significant differences observed in all pairwise comparisons.
 The differences are not only numerical but also conceptual, as FC’s superior
 performance can likely be attributed to its stability, flexibility, and
 ability to handle the data’s nuances more effectively.
 In contrast, models like BAYES and PCA seem more affected by changes in
 the data or problem conditions.
 This analysis highlights FC as the most reliable and high-performing model
 among those evaluated.

The study examines the application of feature construction techniques for
 predicting the duration of forest fires using data collected in Greece
 over a ten-year period.
 The methods utilized include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum
 Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR), and Grammatical Evolution for constructing
 artificial features and generating neural networks.
 The analysis focused on meteorological parameters such as temperature,
 humidity, wind, and rainfall, which significantly influence the behavior
 of forest fires.
 The research concluded that the feature construction technique, using grammatic
al evolution, outperforms other methods in terms of stability and accuracy.
 The results indicated that this technique achieved the lowest error rate
 in predicting fire duration compared to other approaches such as PCA, MRMR,
 and traditional algorithms like Bayes and Adam.
 While PCA proved effective for dimensionality reduction, it often led to
 a loss of critical information.
 MRMR, though capable of identifying relevant features, did not exhibit
 consistent performance across all datasets.
 Traditional algorithms like Bayes showed significant variability, with
 their performance heavily influenced by the data characteristics.
 Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test demonstrated the clear superiority
 of feature construction over other methods.
 This advantage can be attributed to the technique's ability to adapt to
 the peculiarities of the data, avoiding the information loss observed with
 other approaches.
 Specifically, the method excelled in both accuracy and robustness.
 The study's findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning
 techniques in addressing critical environmental challenges such as forest
 fires.
 Future research could focus on integrating data from diverse geographical
 regions or climatic conditions, developing automated real-time monitoring
 systems, and combining advanced algorithms for even more efficient analysis.
 Incorporating social and environmental factors into predictive models could
 also offer a multidimensional understanding of the causes and spread of
 fires.
 Overall, this study highlights the importance of scientific approaches
 and technology in tackling contemporary challenges posed by climate change
 and natural disasters.
