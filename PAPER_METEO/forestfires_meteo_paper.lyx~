\begin_layout Abstract
The spread of contemporary artificial intelligence technologies,
 particularly Machine Learning,
 has significantly enhanced the capacity to predict asymmetrical natural disasters.
 Wildfires constitute a prominent example,
 as machine learning can be employed to forecast not only their spatial extent but also their environmental and socio-economic impacts,
 propagation dynamics,
 
\series bold
\color red
symmetrical or asymmetrical
\series default
 
\series bold
patterns
\series default
\color inherit
 and even their duration.
 Such predictive capabilities are of critical importance for effective wildfire management,
 as they inform the strategic allocation of material resources,
 and the optimal deployment of human personnel in the field.
 Beyond that,
 examination of
\series bold
 symmetrical or asymmetrical patterns
\series default
 in fires,
 helps to understand the causes and dynamic of their spread.
 The necessity of leveraging machine learning tools has become imperative in our era,
 as climate change has disrupted traditional wildfire management models due to prolonged droughts,
 rising temperatures,
 
\series bold
asymmetrical patterns
\series default
,
 and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.
 For this reason,
 our research seeks to fully exploit the potential of Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
 Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR),
 and Grammatical Evolution,
 both for constructing Artificial Features and for generating Neural Network Architectures.
 For this purpose,
 we utilized the highly detailed and publicly available 
\series bold
symmetrical
\series default
 datasets provided by the Hellenic Fire Service for the years 2014–2021,
 which we further enriched with meteorological data,
 corresponding to the prevailing conditions at both the onset,
 and the suppression of each wildfire event.
 The research concluded that the Feature Construction technique,
 using Grammatical Evolution,
 combine both the 
\series bold
symmetrical and asymmetrical
\series default
 
\series bold
conditions
\series default
,
 that weather phenomena may provide and outperforms other methods in terms of stability and accuracy.
 
\series bold
Therefore,
 the asymmetric phenomenon in our research is defined as the unpredictable outcome of climate change (meteorological data) which prolongs the duration of forest fires over time.

\series default
 Specifically,
 the model accuracy of wildfire duration using Feature Construction,
 the mean error was 8.79%,
 indicating an overall accuracy of 91.21%.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section,
 we begin with a brief reference to the dual role that fire has played in shaping human civilization.
 Historically,
 fire has possessed the capacity to either elevate civilizations or bring about their destruction.
 Fire has served as a weapon capable of unleashing unspeakable natural disasters,
 while simultaneously acting as a catalyst for technological advancement.
 For instance,
 the Great fire of London in 1666,
 devastated the city and reshaped the political,
 social,
 demographic,
 and economical landscape
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Field "

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 the ability to harness fire for cooking,
 metallurgy,
 and warmth played a crucial role in the development,
 of early industrial processes and human societies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fire1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This duality,
 underscores fire’s paradoxical role,
 in human progress:
 a force capable of both creation and destruction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This belief is also evident in ancient Greek mythology,
 particularly in the tale of Prometheus,
 who defied the gods by stealing fire,
 and gifting it to humanity.
 This act symbolizes the transfer of divine knowledge and power to humans,
 enabling progress and civilization.
 The myth,
 underscores fire's dual role as a tool for human advancement and as a source of conflict illustrating the tension between progress and its ethical implications as well as the costs of rebellion and innovation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fire2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In other words,
 fire has exerted a multiple role in human history,
 both through myths and its diverse impacts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus,
 in the modern era,
 wildfires are ranked highly among the most significant natural hazards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 with immense effects on Earth's ecosystems,
 and human societies.
 Beyond that according the Chair of ISO/TC 92 fire safety Mr.
 P.
 Van Hees:

In other words wildfires and climate change fuel each other's intensify.
 Climate change interact synergistically with wildfires by increasing drought,
 high temperatures,

 and strong winds,
 leading to more severe,
 and prolonged fire seasons.
 Conversely,
 wildfires contribute to reinforcing climate change 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Thus,
 wildfires (along with the extraction and burning of fossil fuels,

 despite the challenging conditions posed by Climate Change,

 we attempt to transform this disadvantage into an advantage

 Even though,
 modeling multiplex environmental variables,
 repeatedly presents challenges on account of significant computation resources required and the diverseness or complexity of data formats 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Machine learning algorithms,
 nevertheless,
 can bypass these 
\series bold

 challenges by deriving mappings and relationships straight from the data eliminating the need for prespecified expert rules.
 This ability is particularly helpful when dealing with frameworks involving a large number of parameters with complex 
\series bold

 physical properties,
 such as in forest fires.
 Therefore,
 adopting a machine learning technique to fire management can help defeat many of the barriers associated with traditional physics-based simulation models.

 in the current literature,
 noteworthy interest has been developed,

 More specifically,
 floods drawing the most attention in research (20.3%),
 followed by earthquakes and hurricanes,
 each accounting for 18.8%.
 Studies on general disaster types make up 15.9%,
 while landslides account for 10.1%.
 Remarkably,
 depending on the area of focus,
 researchers apply corresponding algorithms to address specified challenges.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Definition of the output variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To define the output variable,
 the duration of each forest fire was converted from hours or other time units into minutes,
 ensuring greater precision in classification.
 A logarithmic transformation of fire duration in minutes was then applied to manage the wide range of values effectively,
 preventing excessive influence from extreme durations.
 Based on this transformation,
 three distinct categories were established,
 serving as target values for experimental analysis.
 This approach enabled the classification of forest fires according to their duration.
 For the Greek forest fire data used in this study,
 the following classification scheme was adopted:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Up to 360 minutes (6 hours) is considered to be a fire,
 of short duration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

,
 and developed by Harold Hotelling (1933).
 This technique operates on the principle that when data from a higher-dimensional space is transformed into a lower-dimensional space,
 the resulting lower-dimensional representation should retain the maximum variance of the original data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably,
 it is worth mentioning that the use of PCA,

 became practical only after the advent of electronic computers,
 which made it computationally feasible,

 Continuing,
 with the applications of PCA,
 it is a widely utilized technique in exploratory data analysis,
 and machine learning,
 particularly,
 in building predictive models.
 It is an unsupervised learning method,
 designed to analyze,
 the relationships among a set of variables.
 Often referred to as a form of general factor analysis,
 it involves regression to determine a line of best fit.
 The primary objective,
 of PCA,
 is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset,
 while retaining the most significant patterns,
 and relationships,
 among the variables,
 all without requiring prior knowledge,
 of the target variables

 Explicitly,
 the research conducted,
 by Park 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

,
 highlights the reasons behind the success of the PCA technique,
 for lattice systems.
 The study's primary limitation lies in the dependency of the proposed formula's accuracy on the dataset size.
 Specifically,
 the results achieve full precision,
 only under the condition of an infinite dataset.
 This constraint restricts the practical applicability,
 of the method,
 when working with finite or limited data,
 a common scenario,
 in real-world analyses.

Additionally,
 the work of Sarma et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 utilizes PCA,
 in order to evaluate,
 morphometric traits,
 under a multivariate approach.
 The findings suggest,
 that PCA could significantly enhance the genetic improvement.
 Noteworthy,
 is the fact,
 that the 64.29%,
 of the total variance explained,
 can be considered relatively low.
 This suggests,
 that a significant amount of unexplained information remains,
 which is not captured,
 by the four principal components.

Subsequently,
 we will briefly mention certain studies,
 that have been conducted,
 in the field of Forest Fires.
 Guan's research focuses on forest fire prediction using PCA-preprocessed data.
 The preprocessing step removed irrelevant information,
 simplifying analysis.
 Linear regression and random forest methods were then applied,
 revealing temperature,
 relative humidity,
 wind,
 and rain as the most influential factors in forest fire occurrence

 was applied to reduce 195 meteorological variables,
 from the NARR dataset,
 to a smaller set of significant fire-ignition predictors,
 later used in logistic regression,
 to calculate wildfire ignition probabilities

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents the percentage values of classification error for various machine learning models from 2014 to 2021,
 as well as the average error rate for each model.
 The analysis reveals significant insights regarding the performance and stability of the methods.
 The BAYES model exhibits the highest variability,
 with a particularly high error rate in 2017 (53.36%).
 This is a clear outlier,
 possibly due to specific conditions in the data or the evaluation framework.
 In other years,
 its error rates range between 7.79% and 11.81%.
 The average error rate for BAYES is 19.41%,
 the highest in the table,
 indicating the lowest overall accuracy compared to the other models.
 The ADAM model shows an average error rate of 11.39%,
 with values ranging from 9.44% to 13.00%.
 Its stability is evident,
 as there are no significant deviations in specific years.
 ADAM's performance is considered relatively good compared to other methods.
 The BFGS model has an average error rate of 11.94%,
 slightly higher than ADAM's.
 Its error rates range from 9.66% to 14.97%.
 Although it demonstrates stable performance,
 its higher average value suggests slightly lower accuracy in certain cases.
 The MRMR model has an average error rate of 9.75%,
 ranking it among the most accurate methods.
 However,
 its error rate reaches 12.65% in 2017,
 while remaining low in other years,
 making it a reliable option overall.
 The PCA model has an average error rate of 12.14%,
 which is among the highest in the table.
 It shows relatively stable values,
 with a slight increase to 15.50% in 2014.
 Despite its generally good performance,
 its accuracy is lower compared to other methods such as MRMR or FC.
 The NNC model has an average error rate of 9.72%,
 one of the lowest in the table.
 Its values range from 7.03% to 12.61%,
 with small deviations,
 demonstrating stability and reliability.
 The FC model has the lowest average error rate in the table,
 at 8.79%,
 making it the most accurate method overall.
 Its error rates range between 6.62% and 12.66%,
 indicating stable performance with minor fluctuations.
 In conclusion,
 FC is the most accurate model,
 with the lowest average error rate,
 while BAYES demonstrates the lowest accuracy due to its high average error rate and significant variability.
 Methods such as MRMR and NNC are also reliable,
 with low error rates and relatively stable performance.
 The observed deviations in specific years might be related to changes in the data or evaluation parameters.

,
 the results of the Wilcoxon test for pairwise comparisons of the classification models are presented,
 providing valuable insights into the statistical significance of their performance differences.
 Below is a more in-depth analysis,
 focusing on the interpretation of results and a deeper understanding of the relationships between the models.
 The overall result of the Wilcoxon test (p < 0.5) confirms that statistically significant differences exist among the models' performances.
 This indicates that the models are not equivalent in terms of their accuracy,
 with some clearly outperforming others.
 The comparison between FC and NNC (p = 0.039) reveals a statistically significant difference,
 though the p-value is relatively close to the significance threshold (commonly p < 0.05).
 This suggests that while FC outperforms NNC,
 the difference is not exceedingly pronounced.
 This outcome might be influenced by specific data characteristics or variations in the models' stability.
 The comparison between FC and PCA (p = 0.016) shows a clearer statistically significant difference.
 FC's performance is evidently superior to PCA’s,
 which may be attributed to the fundamental differences in their methodologies.
 PCA,
 as a dimensionality reduction technique,
 might lose critical information in the data,
 leading to lower accuracy in certain scenarios.
 For the comparison between FC and MRMR (p = 0.039),
 a statistically significant difference is observed once again.
 Similar to the FC-NNC comparison,
 this difference exists but is not highly pronounced.
 MRMR,
 which selects features based on mutual information,
 might not perform as consistently across all datasets,
 giving FC an edge.
 The comparison between FC and BFGS (p = 0.016) indicates an even more distinct difference.
 BFGS,
 as an optimization method,
 may lack the flexibility or precision required for classification tasks,
 allowing FC to demonstrate more stable and superior performance in this case.
 The difference between FC and ADAM (p = 0.023) is also statistically significant.
 While ADAM is generally considered an effective algorithm in many contexts,
 FC appears to outperform it in this analysis,
 possibly due to better adaptability to the specific characteristics of the dataset.
 The most striking difference is seen in the comparison between FC and BAYES (p = 0.0078).
 The very low p-value strongly confirms a statistically significant difference,
 highlighting FC’s clear superiority over BAYES.
 Notably,
 BAYES has exhibited high variability in its performance,
 especially in 2017,
 when it recorded a very high error rate.
 This variability likely reduces its overall reliability,
 which is reflected in this comparison.
 In summary,
 FC consistently outperforms all other models in this analysis,
 with statistically significant differences observed in all pairwise comparisons.
 The differences are not only numerical but also conceptual,
 as FC’s superior performance can likely be attributed to its stability,
 flexibility,
 and ability to handle the data’s nuances more effectively.
 In contrast,
 models like BAYES and PCA seem more affected by changes in the data or problem conditions.
 This analysis highlights FC as the most reliable and high-performing model among those evaluated.

The data in Table

 present the classification error rates for the "FC" machine learning model across different numbers of constructed features (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

) generated using Grammatical Evolution,
 spanning the years 2014 to 2021.
 These results provide insights into the impact of the number of features on the model's performance over time.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

,
 the classification error rates exhibit variability across the years,
 ranging from a minimum of 6.77% in 2019 to a maximum of 12.68% in 2017.
 The average error rate for this configuration is 9.03%,
 indicating a relatively moderate level of accuracy overall.
 The peak error in 2017 suggests possible challenges in that year's data or specific interactions between the model and the constructed feature set.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

,
 the classification error rates show a slightly improved overall performance compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

,
 with an average error of 8.79%.
 The error rates range from 6.62% in 2019,
 marking the lowest rate for this configuration,
 to 12.66% in 2017,
 the highest.
 These results indicate that adding one more feature generally leads to improved accuracy,
 although the improvement is not uniform across all years.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

,
 the classification error rates demonstrate further improvement,
 with an average error of 8.63%,
 which is the lowest among the three configurations.
 The error rates range from a minimum of 6.49% in 2019 to a maximum of 12.46% in 2017.
 The slightly lower peak error compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 suggests that the inclusion of a third constructed feature enhances the model's ability to capture data patterns more effectively.
 Across all configurations,
 the year 2017 consistently exhibits the highest classification error rates,
 irrespective of the number of features.
 This outlier suggests specific data-related challenges or unique model behavior during that year.
 Conversely,
 2019 consistently shows the lowest error rates,
 indicating favorable conditions for accurate classification during that period.
 The trend in the average classification error rates decreasing from 9.03% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 to 8.63% for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 demonstrates that the addition of constructed features through Grammatical Evolution positively impacts the model's accuracy.
 However,
 the diminishing returns between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 suggest that the incremental benefit of adding more features may plateau after a certain point.
 In conclusion,
 the analysis reveals that increasing the number of constructed features generally improves the accuracy of the "FC" model.
 The results highlight the importance of balancing feature complexity and model performance while considering the specific characteristics of the data across different years.

 a statistical analysis was conducted using the Wilcoxon Test (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) to compare classification error rates among configurations with different numbers of constructed features (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1,N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

).
 The results of the test provide valuable insights into the statistical significance of the differences in the performance of these configurations.
 The overall result of the Wilcoxon Test,
 with p < 0.5,
 indicates that statistically significant differences exist in at least one of the pairwise comparisons between the configurations.
 Specifically,
 the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 yields p = 0.15,
 which is not statistically significant.
 This suggests that adding a second constructed feature does not lead to a significant improvement in the model’s performance.
 On the other hand,
 the comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 shows p = 0.016,
 a statistically significant value.
 This indicates that the inclusion of a third constructed feature substantially enhances the model’s accuracy compared to using only one feature.
 The comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 also reveals a statistically significant difference,
 with p = 0.023.
 This result suggests that even the transition from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 leads to an improvement in performance,
 although the difference is less pronounced than between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

.
 Overall,
 the analysis demonstrates that increasing the number of constructed features from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 results in a statistically significant improvement in the model’s accuracy.
 The comparison between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 is not statistically significant,
 possibly due to the limited impact of adding only one additional feature.
 In contrast,
 the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{f}=3$
\end_inset

 highlights that further increasing the number of features continues to enhance performance,
 albeit to a lesser degree.

\begin_layout Standard
The study examines the application of feature construction techniques for predicting the duration of forest fires using data collected in Greece over a ten-year period.
 The methods utilized include Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
 Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR),
 and Grammatical Evolution for constructing artificial features and generating neural networks.
 The analysis focused on meteorological parameters such as temperature,
 humidity,
 wind,
 and rainfall,
 which significantly influence the behavior of forest fires.
 The research concluded that the feature construction technique,
 using grammatical evolution,
 outperforms other methods in terms of stability and accuracy.
 The results indicated that this technique achieved the lowest error rate in predicting fire duration compared to other approaches such as PCA,
 MRMR,
 and traditional algorithms like Bayes and Adam.
 While PCA proved effective for dimensionality reduction,
 it often led to a loss of critical information.
 MRMR,
 though capable of identifying relevant features,
 did not exhibit consistent performance across all datasets.
 Traditional algorithms like Bayes showed significant variability,
 with their performance heavily influenced by the data characteristics.
 Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test demonstrated the clear superiority of feature construction over other methods.
 This advantage can be attributed to the technique's ability to adapt to the peculiarities of the data,
 avoiding the information loss observed with other approaches.
 Specifically,
 the method excelled in both accuracy and robustness.
 The study's findings underscore the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in addressing critical environmental challenges such as forest fires.
 Future research could focus on integrating data from diverse geographical regions or climatic conditions,
 developing automated real-time monitoring systems,
 and combining advanced algorithms for even more efficient analysis.
 Incorporating social and environmental factors into predictive models could also offer a multidimensional understanding of the causes and spread of fires.
 Overall,
 this study highlights the importance of scientific approaches and technology in tackling contemporary challenges posed by climate change and natural disasters.
