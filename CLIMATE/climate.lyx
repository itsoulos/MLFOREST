\begin_layout Abstract
Climate change is no longer a future or hypothetical issue,
 but a present reality with tangible consequences and impacts on the well-being not only of the planet itself but also of all living organisms that constitute the ecosystem.
 Since 1969,
 the global surface temperature has been surpassing its own record almost every year,
 with NASA’s final measurement for 2024 indicating an increase of approximately 2.65° Fahrenheit or 1.47° Celsius,
 in global temperature.
 These measurements indicate that we have reached the thresholds established by the United Nations,
 scientists,
 and member states through the Paris Agreement of 2015.
 In this study,
 we seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of climate change,
 and more specifically of its environmental impacts across seven distinct regions located in different climatic zones.
 Particular emphasis is placed on highlighting the rate at which climate change has altered annual temperature patterns during the period 1995–2025.
 To achieve this,
 we evaluated multiple modeling techniques and proposed the use of Grammatical Evolution with rule-based construction as the most suitable approach.
 GENCLASS,
 demonstrates robust and systematic superiority over the considered baselines (MLP,
 RBF,
 SVM,
 and NNC) across all datasets,
 achieving the lowest average classification error and indicating strong cross-regional generalization.
 In our research,
 we will examine a broad spectrum of climatic zones,
 specifically focusing on the Congo region,
 Saudi Arabia,
 Greece,
 Turkey,
 Reykjavik in Iceland,
 the Arctic Svalbard archipelago,
 and Cape Town in South Africa.
 Our experiments yielded highly robust results,
 with an average error rate of 1.66% and a classification accuracy of 98.34% for predicting climate change categories.
 These outcomes were further confirmed through established validation techniques,
 reinforcing the reliability of the model’s performance.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The power of nature and its capacity to respond when ecological balances are disrupted has long been recognized.
 A striking early example appears in The Persians by Aeschylus,
 a classical tragedy written in 472 BCE that recounts the historical events of 480 BCE 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The play depicts the environmental and human catastrophes that afflicted the Persian army during its chaotic retreat,
 following acts that violated the natural world.
 Historical sources describe these transgressions,
 including the “chaining” of the Bosporus through the construction of a floating bridge,
 the plundering of agricultural lands to sustain their vast forces,
 and the burning and devastation of forests and plains—
actions intended to deprive local populations of essential resources.
 Such accounts illustrate that every action elicits a reaction,
 even from nature itself,
 which does not remain a passive observer but acts as a regulating force that safeguards the planet’s equilibrium.

\begin_layout Standard
Recent scientific consensus confirms that anthropogenic factors,
 especially fossil fuel combustion,
 deforestation,
 and industrial emissions,play a pivotal role in driving climate change and its associated extreme events.In summary,
 climate change has been linked to extreme natural disaster events,
 including heat waves and cold spells,
 droughts,
 tropical storms and high winds,
 river floods,
 coastal floods

 In particular,
 according to the United Nations,
 climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature and weather patterns.
 While such variations may occur naturally—
stemming from fluctuations in solar activity or major volcanic eruptions—
human activities have emerged as the predominant cause since the 19th century.
 This anthropogenic influence is primarily attributed to the extensive combustion of fossil fuels,
 including coal,
 oil,
 and natural gas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 As will be demonstrated through the data presented below,
 climate change has entered an irreversible trajectory,
 with each passing year bearing witness to phenomena that repeatedly set new temperature records.
 Nevertheless,
 notable efforts have been made in the past—
through treaties,
 regulations,
 targets,
 and constraints—
aiming to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in an attempt to intercept climate change at a critical threshold.
 Specifically,
 the 1992 UN Conference of Environment and Development set as its ultimate objective

the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere

.
 In 1997,
 the Kyoto Protocol was adopted with the aim of committing industrialized nations and economies in transition to limit and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
 based on individually agreed targets.
 The overarching Convention,
 however,
 merely requires these countries to implement mitigation policies and measures,
 and to submit periodic reports 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "United Nations 1997"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In 2015,
 the Paris Agreement articulated long-term goals intended to guide 195 Parties in substantially reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.
 Its central aim is to constrain the rise in global temperatures to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels,
 while encouraging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.
 Achieving these targets is recognized as a critical step towards significantly mitigating the risks and adverse impacts associated with climate change 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Although we briefly observed the emergence of more environmentally conscious actions in the past,
 today,
 in the year 2025,
 NASA's data indicate that the debate has shifted to whether humanity will surpass the critical threshold of 1.5°C or 2.7°F global temperature

In the field of climate change projections,
 numerous studies have been conducted.
 The first scientifically documented prediction of climate change was made in 1896,
 by Svante Arrhenius,
 in his work

.The aforementioned scholar estimated that the combustion of fossil fuels could ultimately emit sufficient carbon dioxide to raise the Earth’s temperature by approximately 5 - 6°C or 9 - 11°F.
 Since then,
 approximately 130 years have passed;
 nevertheless,
 the fundamental physics underlying these calculations has remained unchanged.
 What has evolved are the techniques employed in our projections,
 which have become considerably more detailed and precise

.
 It is evident that climate change is intrinsically linked to global warming and the increasing occurrence of natural disasters,
 such as wildfires,
 floods,
 droughts,
 extreme weather events,
 landslides,
 and storms.
 In this context,
 we will refer to several studies on climate change and forest fires,
 such as:
 Koulelis et al.,
 in 2023,
 conducted a study reviewing the impacts of climate change on Greek forests,
 examining factors such as climate trends,
 forest management practices,
 biodiversity,
 genetics,
 insect activity,
 and wildfires,
 drawing upon data from the Scopus and Mendeley databases as well as official reports 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The findings of Rovithakis et al.,
 in 2022,
 indicate that fire danger is projected to progressively intensify in the future,
 particularly under the high-end climate change scenario 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 Giannakopoulos et al.,
 in 2011,
 reported that shifting climate conditions,
 marked by an average increase in minimum temperatures of approximately 1.3°C and a 15% reduction in winter precipitation—
indicate an intensified risk of forest fires in the future 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Giannakopoulos 2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Comparable studies have linked floods to climate change,
 such as:
 Knox,
 in 2000,
 reported that flood chronologies from multiple regions indicate that periods of rapid climate change tend to coincide with more frequent occurrences of large and extreme flooding events 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Knox 2000"

 Milly et al.,
 in 2002,
 found that the frequency of major floods increased significantly throughout the twentieth century 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Bronstert,
 in 2003,
 highlighted that anthropogenic activities contributing to heightened flood risk encompass river regulation practices,
 intensified land use and forestry,
 as well as greenhouse gas emissions that drive changes in the global climate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Subsequently,
 we will discuss studies addressing drought and its linkage to climate change,
 including:
 Cook et al.,
 in 2018,
 projected that rising temperatures will heighten both the risk and severity of drought across large parts of the subtropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres,
 as a result of regional declines in precipitation combined with widespread warming 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cook 2018"

\end_inset

.
 Mukherjee et al.,
 in 2018,
 noted that while droughts are natural phenomena,
 climate change has generally accelerated hydrological processes,
 causing them to develop more rapidly and with greater intensity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

.
 Yuan et al.,
 in 2023,
 observed that flash droughts—
developing unusually rapidly in contrast to the more gradual archetypal droughts,
 are increasingly becoming the new normal

Consequently,
 research on rising temperatures has attracted significant scientific interest.
 Subsequently,
 we will present studies that focus on the field of climate change,
 specifically on the projection of such meteorological phenomena.

This paper proposes the application of a technique for automatically generating classification rules to predict climate change in various regions of our planet.
 These rules are expressed in a C - like programming language and they can also detect hidden correlations between the features of the problem and use only those features that contain the most important information for the correct classification or patterns of the objective problem.
 In contrast to conventional AI methods,
 the proposed framework produces interpretable C\SpecialChar nobreakdash
like rules while simultaneously performing implicit feature selection,
 enabling more explainable and efficient climate\SpecialChar nobreakdash
prediction models.

The 1.5°C target is highly ambitious and is likely to have been surpassed by 2025,
 nevertheless,
 it remains significant as a benchmark for minimizing,
 to the greatest extent possible,
 the impacts of natural disasters that are exacerbated by climate change.
 Subsequently,
 we will present numerical evidence illustrating how major natural disasters have become increasingly frequent and intense over time,
 as a result of the evolving impacts of climate change.

\begin_layout Standard
According to the available data,
 we conclude that natural disasters have increased over the past 30 years when compared with the preceding 94 years.
 More specifically,
 there has been a rise in droughts,
 floods,
 wildfires,
 landslides,
 storms,
 extreme temperatures,
 and epidemics.
 Geophysical events,
 by contrast,
 appear to have remained stable in number,
 given that the comparison is made against a period three times longer.
 In addition,
 two new categories have emerged.

The Dataset Employed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study,
 we utilized Historical Weather Data provided by Visual Crossing

\end_layout

\end_inset

,
 (last accessed on 08 December 2025),
 which aggregates information from multiple authoritative sources,
 including national meteorological services,
 global climate models,
 and satellite observations.In order to gain access to the historical data,
 we first completed the registration process.
 Subsequently,
 by selecting data access,
 we defined the region of interest and the desired date range.
 We then proceeded with the data retrieval process,
 with a limit of 1,000 records per day in order to remain within the free access tier.
 The overall procedure is straightforward,
 and the only limitation encountered was the daily cap of 1,000 data points.

The Dataset Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We downloaded historical meteorological data covering the period from 1995 to 2025,
 spanning approximately 30 years,
 to support the needs of our climate change research.
 In addition,
 we selected regions across different geographical latitudes and longitudes in order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the areas most affected by the global increase in temperature.
 The selected regions of interest are:
 Congo,
 Saudi Arabia,
 Greece,
 Turkey,
 Reykjavik,
 Svalbard,
 and Cape Town.
 The climatic data for all regions span the period from January 1,
 1995,
 to December 8,
 2025.
 Specifically,
 Turkey provides the most complete dataset with 11,300 days of recordings,
 followed by Saudi Arabia with 11,299 days,
 Svalbard with 11,297 days,
 Greece with 11,291 days,
 Congo with 11,202 days,
 Iceland with 11,140 days,
 and finally Cape Town with 10,957 days.
 All regions have consistent 30 columns structure 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

,
 30+ years of data per region,
 and multiple climate zones,
 such as:
 Mediterranean (Greece & Turkey),
 Arctic (Iceland Reykjavik & Svalbard),
 Desert (Saudi Arabia),
 Tropical (Congo),
 Temperate (Cape Town).
 The differences in the number of data entries are due to gaps (missing values) present in the records obtained from Visual Crossing,
 which did not affect our results.

In summary,
 we report the maximum and minimum values of the average temperature for each region.
 For Greece,
 the highest recorded value was 36°C (96.8°F) on July 21,
 2011,
 while the lowest was −26.33°C (-15.4°F) on January 27,
 2003.
 In Turkey,
 the maximum temperature was recorded on July 30,
 2000,
 at 41.05°C (105.9°F),
 while the minimum reached −22.94°C (−9.3°F) on February 16,
 2006.
 In Saudi Arabia,
 the maximum temperature approached 48.2°C (118.9°F) on May 30,
 2021,
 while the minimum reached −2.05°C (28.3°F) on January 17,
 2008.
 In Cape Town,
 the maximum temperature reached 42°C (107.6°F) on February 3,
 2015,
 while the minimum was 0.05°C (32.1°F),
 a value that occurred seven times:
 twice in July 1996,
 twice in 2000,
 and once in 2001,
 2002,
 and 2003.
 In Reykjavik,
 Iceland,
 the maximum temperature was 25.7°C (78.3°F) on July 30,

From these observations,
 it is striking that Greece recorded the lowest temperature −26.33°C (-15.4°F),
 followed by Turkey −22.94°C (−9.3°F) compared to regions located within the Arctic Circle,
 while the highest value was,
 as expected,
 observed in Saudi Arabia,
 a country characterized by a desert climate.
 In addition,
 over the period from January 1,
 1995,
 to December 8,
 2025,
 all seven regions under investigation exhibited an increase in mean temperature,
 albeit with varying magnitudes.
 Turkey recorded the highest rise at 1.92°C (3.46°F),
 followed by Reykjavik with 1.41°C (2.54°F) and Greece with 1.22°C (2.20°F).
 More moderate increases were observed in Svalbard (0.93°C;
 1.67°F),
 Cape Town (0.81°C;
 1.46°F),
 and Saudi Arabia (0.79°C;
 1.42°F).
 Congo displayed the smallest change,
 with only 0.10°C (0.18°F).
 These findings highlight both regional disparities and the broader trend of warming consistent with the impacts of climate change

After examining our dataset and identifying the variations in temperature across the seven regions under study,
 we proceeded with the classification of temperatures.
 To achieve this,
 the classification scheme required adaptation for each region individually.
 Specifically,
 we calculated the mean temperature for each region using the first five years of data,
 namely from 1995 to 2000.
 This mean value was employed as the baseline.
 Temperatures that were either lower or higher by up to 1°C (±1.8°F) relative to this baseline were assigned to Class 0,
 whereas temperatures exceeding the baseline by more than 1.1°C (≈2.0°F) were assigned to Class 1

The definition of the two classes was based on the environmental considerations discussed in our introduction,
 aligned with the Paris Agreement and the 1.5 °C climate target,
 as well as on our data-driven analyses and the class balance that we were able to achieve.
 Similarly,
 the temporal span of our dataset was selected to align with the climatological milestones commonly used to characterize the progression of climate change.
 For this reason,
 we adopted the period 1995–2025 as the analysis window across the different climatic regions.
 Furthermore,
 the definition of our classes was made with careful consideration,
 and the first class explicitly includes negative temperature anomalies,
 as it encompasses all temperature values from below zero up to +1 °C.

The rationale for selecting the initial five-year period was to establish a reference point unaffected by the extreme temperature fluctuations associated with climate change,
 given that our dataset spans from 1995 to 2025.
 This approach ensured that the classification was grounded in a stable climatic baseline,
 thereby enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current work proposed the incorporation of a method that constructs classification rules,
 initially proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore,
 this method was implemented as a software recently 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "genclass_softx"

\end_inset

.
 The published software GENCLASS is an open\SpecialChar nobreakdash
source software tool,
 publicly available on GitHub (
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

https://github.com/itsoulos/GenClass/
\end_layout

\end_inset

),
 where detailed installation instructions and usage examples are provided.
 The software is implemented in ANSI C++ and supports Python\SpecialChar nobreakdash
formatted rule output.
 Its execution is controlled through a set of command\SpecialChar nobreakdash
line parameters that define all key aspects of the method,
 including the number of chromosomes,
 number of generations,
 mutation rate,
 and other evolutionary settings.
 The implementation relies on OpenMP for multicore parallelization and uses Grammatical Evolution with a BNF grammar to generate human\SpecialChar nobreakdash
readable classification rules.
 The underlying grammar for this method is provided in Figure

Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 reports the percentage classification error obtained by five machine learning models (MLP,
 RBF,
 SVM,
 NNC,
 and the proposed GENCLASS) across seven region-specific climate-zone datasets (CAPETOWN,
 GREECE,
 ICELAND,
 KONGO,
 ARABIA,
 SVALBARD,
 TURKEY).
 Since the entries are error percentages,
 lower values indicate higher classification accuracy,
 while the final row (AVERAGE) summarizes the mean error over all datasets.
 The dominant outcome is the consistent superiority of GENCLASS,
 which achieves the lowest error on every dataset and the best overall average (1.66%).
 Importantly,
 this performance should be interpreted in light of the strong geographical and environmental heterogeneity represented by the selected regions,
 spanning a wide range of latitudes and longitudes and encompassing markedly different physical settings (coastal versus inland areas,
 mountainous terrain,
 forests,
 deserts,
 glaciers/sea ice,
 and distinct hemispheric seasonality).
 Such factors affect local temperature dynamics,
 variability,
 and seasonality and therefore shape the complexity of the classification patterns that each model must learn.
 For instance,
 KONGO lies close to the Equator (approximately within a few degrees north and south of 0° latitude,
 primarily at eastern longitudes in Central Africa) and is characterized by extensive tropical rainforest cover and high atmospheric moisture.
 In this dataset,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Experimental-results-on"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 shows the highest errors for most methods and also the largest GENCLASS error (4.84%),
 suggesting a comparatively more challenging classification structure,
 plausibly due to weaker temperature seasonality and stronger interactions with humidity and cloud-related processes.
 In contrast,
 ARABIA (roughly 16°-32°N at eastern longitudes in Western Asia) is dominated by hot desert conditions,
 where land-surface properties,
 low cloudiness,
 and persistent aridity often yield clearer and more repeatable temperature-related signatures,
 accordingly,
 GENCLASS attains a very low error (0.73%) and NNC also performs strongly.
 In the Mediterranean/subtropical band,
 GREECE (approximately 35°-41°N,
 20°-28°E) combines strong maritime influence,
 extensive coastline and island geography,
 and pronounced mountainous terrain,
 all of which introduce microclimatic variability,
 nevertheless,
 GENCLASS remains highly accurate (0.85%),
 indicating robust handling of nonlinear interactions linked to elevation,
 coastal effects,
 and seasonal transitions typical of Mediterranean climates.
 TURKEY (approximately 36°-42°N,
 26°-45°E) is even more heterogeneous,
 with coastal zones influenced by surrounding seas and inland plateaus and mountain ranges exhibiting more continental conditions,
 despite this diversity,
 GENCLASS again yields the smallest error (0.63%),
 whereas conventional baselines such as MLP and SVM show substantially larger errors.
 At higher latitudes,
 ICELAND (approximately 63°-66°N,
 at western longitudes in the North Atlantic) is shaped by oceanic forcing,
 strong winds,
 glaciers,
 and complex volcanic topography,
 which can increase meteorological variability,
 still,
 GENCLASS keeps the error relatively low (2.47%) compared with the other methods.
 SVALBARD (approximately 74°-81°N at eastern longitudes in the Arctic Ocean) represents an Arctic archipelago with extensive glaciation/sea-ice influence and extreme photoperiodicity (polar night and midnight sun),
 conditions that can produce strong seasonal contrasts and circulation-driven variability,
 nevertheless,
 GENCLASS remains the most accurate method (1.11%),
 with NNC as the next best performer.
 Finally,
 CAPETOWN (approximately 34°S,
 18°E) lies in the Southern Hemisphere and is typically described by a Mediterranean-type regime with strong coastal forcing and nearby mountainous relief that modulates winds and temperature variability,
 here too GENCLASS attains the lowest error (0.97%).
 The AVERAGE row confirms that,
 when aggregating across all these diverse geographic coordinates and environmental contexts,
 GENCLASS provides the most reliable generalization with the smallest mean error,
 while NNC consistently ranks second.
 Overall,
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Experimental-results-on"
plural "false"
caps "false"

nolink "false"

\end_inset

 supports not only that GENCLASS is more accurate,
 but also that it generalizes effectively across datasets derived from regions with fundamentally different latitude–longitude positioning and physical environments,
 suggesting improved capacity to capture nonlinear relationships and interactions induced by topography,
 land cover (forest/desert/ice),
 proximity to oceans,
 and regional seasonality.

The results summarized in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 indicate that the comparison GENCLASS vs MLP yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0195$
\end_inset

,
 implying a statistically significant difference (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

) and supporting the conclusion that GENCLASS outperforms MLP under the adopted experimental setting.
 The comparison GENCLASS vs RBF results in 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.2492$
\end_inset

,
 which is not significant (ns,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

),
 therefore,
 given the available datasets,
 there is insufficient statistical evidence to claim a systematic performance difference between GENCLASS and RBF at the 5% significance level.
 In contrast,
 GENCLASS vs SVM yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=8.74\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

,
 an extremely small value (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

),
 providing very strong statistical evidence that GENCLASS outperforms SVM on the evaluated datasets.
 The comparison GENCLASS vs NNC produces 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.6583$
\end_inset

 (ns),
 suggesting that no statistically significant difference can be established between GENCLASS and NNC.
 Finally,
 the overall Friedman test reports 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.49\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

),
 confirming that,
 when all models are jointly considered across all datasets,
 there are statistically significant performance differences and the methods cannot be regarded as equivalent.
 Overall,
 these findings substantiate that GENCLASS is decisively and statistically superior to SVM and significantly different from MLP,
 while differences relative to RBF and NNC are not statistically significant under the 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

 criterion.

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset related to the KONGO country remains the most challenging dataset.
 A possible explanation for this outcome is that,
 as noted in the detailed Dataset Description in Section 2.2,
 the Congo region does not exhibit balanced class distributions compared to the other areas.
 This imbalance likely contributes to the slight deviation observed relative to the rest of our data.

The Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Precision-and-recall"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 reports precision and recall for the three learning models (MLP,
 RBF,
 and GENCLASS) across the seven regions (ARABIA,
 CAPETOWN,
 GREECE,
 ICELAND,
 KONGO,
 SVALBARD,
 TURKEY).
 Precision reflects the purity of positive predictions (the fraction of predicted positives that are correct),
 whereas recall reflects the detection rate of the actual positives (the fraction of true positives that are correctly identified).
 GENCLASS consistently achieves the best performance on both metrics for all regions,
 exhibiting near-ceiling values with limited variation (precision approximately 0.950-0.996 and recall approximately 0.946-0.996).
 RBF is generally the second-best approach and reaches high values in several regions (e.g.,
 GREECE/ICELAND/ARABIA/TURKEY around 0.92-0.96),
 but it degrades sharply in CAPETOWN and KONGO (precision 0.571 and 0.585,
 recall 0.735 and 0.644),
 which is visible as pronounced drops in the corresponding curve.
 MLP yields the weakest results overall,
 with precision approximately 0.576-0.711 and recall approximately 0.711-0.852,
 indicating substantially lower correctness of positive predictions and reduced ability to capture positive instances compared to the other methods.
 Overall,
 the figure provides clear empirical evidence that GENCLASS delivers the most robust and consistently strong classification behavior across regions while maintaining simultaneously high precision and high recall.

 evaluates the sensitivity of the proposed model to the number of chromosomes 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

,
 using classification error percentages as the performance metric (lower is better).
 A clear and nearly monotonic improvement is observed as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 increases from 50 to 1000:
 the mean error (AVERAGE row) drops from 3.21% to 1.46%,
 i.e.,
 an absolute reduction of 1.75 percentage points corresponding to an approximate 54.5% relative decrease.
 Most of the gain is realized up to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=500 (3.21%→2.68%→2.17%→1.66%),
 whereas the additional improvement from 500 to 1000 is smaller (1.66%→1.46%,
 a 0.20 decrease),
 indicating diminishing returns for very large chromosome counts.
 At the dataset level,
 the largest relative reductions from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=50 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=1000 occur for ARABIA (2.52%→0.54%,
 ~78.6%) and TURKEY (2.37%→0.57%,
 ~75.9%).
 In contrast,
 ICELAND exhibits a smaller but consistent overall reduction (3.22%→2.14%,
 ~33.5%) and a slight non-monotonic fluctuation at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=100 (3.27% vs.
 3.22%),
 which is corrected for higher 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 KONGO remains the most challenging dataset across all settings (8.86% at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=50 and 4.39% at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=1000),
 implying that increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 substantially improves performance but does not fully remove the intrinsic difficulty associated with that region’s data structure.
 Importantly,
 cross-dataset variability also decreases with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

:
 the maximum error decreases from 8.86% to 4.39% and the range (max-min) shrinks from 7.08 to 3.85 percentage points,
 while the standard deviation of errors across datasets declines from about 2.54 to 1.40,
 suggesting more uniform generalization when using larger chromosome counts.

 clearly illustrates that increasing the number of chromosomes leads to lower classification error across essentially all datasets,
 with the mean performance (AVERAGE,
 black dashed line) following a steady downward trend.
 The improvement is most pronounced from small 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 values up to approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

=500,
 after which the error continues to decrease but at a slower rate,
 indicating diminishing returns for very large chromosome counts.
 Moreover,
 the dataset-specific curves become slightly more clustered as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

 increases,
 suggesting a more uniform behavior of the proposed model across regions.

Table

\end_inset

 investigates the effect of the number of generations 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 on the proposed model,
 using classification error percentages as the evaluation metric (lower is better).
 The overall trend is strongly improving with increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

:
 the mean error (AVERAGE) decreases from 4.46% at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=50 to 1.45% at 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=2000,
 corresponding to a 3.01 percentage-point reduction and an approximate 67.4% relative decrease.
 The gains are not evenly distributed across increments:
 50→100 (-0.99),
 100→200 (-0.82),
 200→1000 (-0.98),
 and 1000→2000 (-0.21),
 indicating diminishing returns beyond 1000 generations,
 where additional computational effort yields smaller improvements in the mean error.
 At the dataset level,
 all regions improve substantially from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=50 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=2000,
 with the largest relative reductions observed for TURKEY (2.63%→0.37%,
 ~85.9%) and ARABIA (3.03%→0.63%,
 ~79.2%).
 KONGO also improves markedly (14.12%→4.18%,
 ~70.4%) but remains the most challenging dataset across all settings,
 consistently exhibiting the highest errors.
 ICELAND shows the smallest overall relative improvement (4.32%→2.58%,
 ~40.3%) and a slight degradation from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=1000 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=2000 (2.47%→2.58%),
 suggesting that for certain datasets additional generations may introduce over-training effects and/or stochastic variability that partially offsets expected gains.
 Increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 also reduces cross-dataset variability:
 the maximum error drops from 14.12% to 4.18% and the range (max–min) shrinks from 11.92 to 3.81 percentage points,
 while the standard deviation across datasets decreases from about 4.00 to 1.30,
 supporting a more uniform generalization profile at higher

 shows that increasing the number of generations also yields a systematic reduction in classification error,
 with the mean curve (AVERAGE) improving markedly when moving from few to many generations.
 The largest gains are achieved up to roughly 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=1000,
 while the transition from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=1000 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

=2000 exhibits a clear flattening of the curves,
 implying that additional computational effort produces smaller marginal improvements.
 Although minor dataset-specific fluctuations may occur at the final step,
 the overall pattern confirms that larger

 enhances generalization and reduces error.

\begin_layout Standard
The present study provides empirical evidence that daily temperature time series (1995-2025) across seven regions spanning distinct climate zones exhibit a consistent warming signal,
 albeit with pronounced spatial heterogeneity.
 Mean temperature increases are not uniform:
 Turkey shows the strongest rise,
 followed by Reykjavik and Greece,
 whereas the Congo region displays only marginal changes.
 This spatial contrast underscores that large-scale warming manifests differently depending on geography,
 seasonality,
 maritime influence,
 topography,
 and local atmospheric processes (e.g.,
 humidity and cloud-related dynamics).
 In methodological terms,
 the adoption of a region-specific baseline derived from the early 1995-2000 period proved effective for defining comparable classes across heterogeneous climates,
 supporting relatively balanced class distributions and reducing the risk that the labeling scheme inherits the already intensified warming of recent years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a modeling perspective,
 Grammatical Evolution with rule-based construction (GENCLASS) demonstrates robust and systematic superiority over the considered baselines (MLP,
 RBF,
 SVM,
 and NNC) across all datasets,
 achieving the lowest average classification error and indicating strong cross-regional generalization.
 Importantly,
 the advantage is not limited to the mean performance but extends to consistency across markedly different environmental regimes,
 which is critical for transferability in climate-related applications.
 Statistical validation further corroborates that the observed differences are unlikely to be due to chance:
 the overall Friedman test is highly significant (p = 2.49×10⁻⁵).
 Pairwise comparisons indicate that GENCLASS significantly outperforms SVM and differs significantly from MLP,
 while differences relative to RBF and NNC are not statistically significant at the 0.05 level.
 This pattern is consistent with GENCLASS remaining competitive against strong conventional learners while avoiding the pronounced degradation that some methods exhibit on nonlinear and non-stationary climate time series.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensitivity analyses with respect to key evolutionary parameters strengthen the methodological credibility of the proposed approach.
 Increasing the number of chromosomes (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

) and generations (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

) yields systematic error reductions,
 with clear diminishing returns beyond approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

≈500 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

≈1000,
 suggesting that improvements stem from enhanced search efficacy rather than incidental fluctuations.
 Moreover,
 the persistent relative difficulty of the KONGO dataset across all settings is informative:
 in regions with weaker temperature seasonality and stronger coupling between temperature and moisture/cloud processes,
 a binary temperature-deviation labeling scheme may be intrinsically harder to learn,
 motivating either feature enrichment or a revised labeling strategy that better reflects the underlying physical dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameter sensitivity analysis indicates that increasing the number of chromosomes (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

) and the number of generations (
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

) leads to systematic reductions in error,
 while the marginal gains progressively shrink beyond a moderate range of values,
 revealing clear diminishing returns.
 This pattern is expected in genetic and evolutionary computation:
 enlarging the computational budget (via larger populations and/or longer runs) typically improves exploration and convergence at first,
 but eventually enters a saturation regime once the search operates in a sufficiently good region of the solution space.
 Similar observations and interpretations have been reported in the literature on parameter setting/control in evolutionary algorithms,
 as well as in broader empirical studies of hyper-parameter spaces that identify wide viable regions and limited additional benefits beyond certain cost levels

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of the number of generations 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 is reported in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:ExperimentsNG"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experNG"

\end_inset

 and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 Error decreases strongly as 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 increases up to 1000,
 while the step from 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}=1000$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}=2000$
\end_inset

 exhibits a clear flattening (diminishing returns):
 the AVERAGE error drops from 1.66% 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N_{g}=1000\right)$
\end_inset

 to 1.45% 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N_{g}=2000\right)$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 only by 0.21 percentage points.
 For reproducibility and a balanced trade-off between performance and computational effort,
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}=1000$
\end_inset

 is recommended as a practical default,
 which is also the value adopted in the main experimental settings (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:settings"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 This recommendation is consistent with the algorithm definition in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-proposed-method"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

 acts as the maximum number of generations in the termination condition,
 therefore,
 computational effort increases approximately proportionally with the number of generations (for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{c}$
\end_inset

).
 Optionally,
 an early-stopping rule (e.g.,
 stopping when the best fitness does not improve for 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 consecutive generations) can be used to further balance cost and benefit,
 while retaining 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}=1000$
\end_inset

 as the default configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the strong results,
 several limitations delineate the scope of generalization.
 First,
 the data originate from an aggregated provider and may embed temporal inconsistencies,
 missingness patterns,
 or changes in upstream data synthesis over time.
 Second,
 evaluation is conducted using classification error under a binary formulation (Class 0/1),
 which necessarily simplifies a multi-factor climate system and does not quantify predictive uncertainty.
 Third,
 careful time-series-aware evaluation is essential to preclude information leakage from later periods into earlier ones.
 Fourth,
 applying a uniform absolute threshold (±1°C and >1.1°C) for class definition while practical may not be climatically equivalent across tropical versus polar regimes,
 where variability and seasonal structure differ qualitatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work can extend this research along four complementary directions.
 First,
 geographic and climatic coverage should be broadened by incorporating additional regions per climate zone,
 explicitly addressing microclimates (island and mountainous settings),
 and systematically revisiting Antarctica through alternative data sources and missing-data strategies.
 Second,
 the representation of the climate system should be enriched by integrating additional predictors (humidity,
 pressure,
 wind,
 radiation,
 drought indices,
 and teleconnection-related indicators),
 enabling the learned rules to capture drivers rather than only temperature outcomes.
 Third,
 the task formulation should be expanded beyond binary classification toward multi-class regimes and/or regression-based forecasting with explicit horizons (10/20/30 years) and uncertainty quantification,
 thereby improving the operational relevance of the results.
 Fourth,
 experimental protocols should be strengthened with time-aware cross-validation,
 decade-wise stability checks,
 and broader benchmarking against modern hybrid/deep time-series models,
 while retaining the interpretability advantages of rule-based structures.
 Ultimately,
 the most impactful direction is a unified framework that couples predictive accuracy with statistical rigor and interpretable rules,
 ensuring that the resulting climate inferences are not only accurate but also scientifically explainable and actionable for adaptation planning.
